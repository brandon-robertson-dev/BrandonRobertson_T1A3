### Target Audience
The target audience for my site would be anyone interested in my life, my projects that i'm involved in or hiring me to work for/with them.
___
### Tech Stack
To build this site I used HTML for the content, CSS for the styling, layout and animations and i deployed it using GitHub Pages, originally I was going to use Netlify but I couldn't get it working with the folder structure required plus with GitHub I can host the powerpoint presentation and readme.md file.
